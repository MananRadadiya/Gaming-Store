You are a senior frontend architect and UI/UX designer.

Upgrade this existing React + Vite + Tailwind gaming e-commerce project into a premium, startup-level, visually stunning website.

Do NOT rewrite everything.
Refactor and enhance the existing structure.

Goals:

1. Improve spacing, layout alignment, and visual hierarchy.

3. Add premium glassmorphism effects (backdrop-blur, soft borders, subtle gradients).
4. Improve typography scale (bold headings, clean subtext, proper tracking).
5. Add smooth Framer Motion animations (fade-up, staggered cards, hover scale).
6. Improve product cards with:
   - Clean shadow layering
   - Hover elevation
   - Smooth image zoom
   - Premium badges
7. Improve navbar:
   - Sticky, pill-shaped, glass style
   - Smooth dropdown animations
   - Proper spacing between elements
8. Make UI feel like a funded startup (Razer / high-end gaming brand quality).
9. Ensure perfect dark mode styling.
10. Maintain full responsiveness (mobile-first).

Keep the design minimal, modern, high-contrast, and premium.
Do not break functionality.
Focus on UI refinement and polish.

Convert this keyboard product image into a premium, uniform e-commerce product shot for a dark cyberpunk gaming store. Remove the original background completely. Place the keyboard on a pure dark charcoal/black background (#0B0F14). Center the keyboard perfectly with equal padding on all sides. Ensure consistent perspective (top-down slight angle, realistic). Add soft studio lighting from top-left. Add subtle soft shadow directly under the keyboard. Add faint RGB ambient glow reflecting slightly onto the surface. Enhance RGB lighting so it looks vibrant but not oversaturated. Improve clarity and sharpness. Make lighting consistent and realistic. Do NOT exaggerate glow. Do NOT distort proportions. Keep it realistic and production-ready. Output as high-resolution 4K clean product image. Background must be consistent across all products.
Use a fixed 1:1 square ratio at 2000×2000px (or 3000×3000px for 4K-grade assets) with the product centered and scaled to ~75–80% of canvas width for perfect grid alignment.
