You are a senior frontend architect and UI/UX designer.

Upgrade this existing React + Vite + Tailwind gaming e-commerce project into a premium, startup-level, visually stunning website.

Do NOT rewrite everything.
Refactor and enhance the existing structure.

Goals:

1. Improve spacing, layout alignment, and visual hierarchy.

3. Add premium glassmorphism effects (backdrop-blur, soft borders, subtle gradients).
4. Improve typography scale (bold headings, clean subtext, proper tracking).
5. Add smooth Framer Motion animations (fade-up, staggered cards, hover scale).
6. Improve product cards with:
   - Clean shadow layering
   - Hover elevation
   - Smooth image zoom
   - Premium badges
7. Improve navbar:
   - Sticky, pill-shaped, glass style
   - Smooth dropdown animations
   - Proper spacing between elements
8. Make UI feel like a funded startup (Razer / high-end gaming brand quality).
9. Ensure perfect dark mode styling.
10. Maintain full responsiveness (mobile-first).

Keep the design minimal, modern, high-contrast, and premium.
Do not break functionality.
Focus on UI refinement and polish.
